> Well, hello there...

- I'm a DevOps geek who loves to work with `Kubernetes`, but not with `yaml`. 
- I'm a huge fan of [helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile).
- I have written several small cli tool, that you might find in my profile attachements (they are not perfect, but I'm working on it)
- I'm contibuting to [db-operator](https://github.com/kloeckner-i/db-operator) (and if you haven't checked the project yet, you should do it)

If you wanna talk, feel free write in [telegram](https://t.me), or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_allanger) or [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@allanger)
